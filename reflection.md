- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructors to create default classes. When there is no description, the default would appear so it won't throw an error. I also chose a method that includes parameters and overload the method by replacing it with default parameters. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The problems had was making the sellCoffee() to work because the error wass that the method was not used locally. I asked Emily for help on that problem but we solved it by using the method in main. Besides that other methods worked. My advice is to ask for help when needed.
